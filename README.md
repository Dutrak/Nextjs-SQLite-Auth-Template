This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template for user authentication using Prisma SQLite and NextAuth.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Every folder inside the `app/` represents a route, for example: The login page is located inside the `app/login/page.tsx`
